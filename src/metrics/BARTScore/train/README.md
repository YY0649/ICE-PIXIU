<h2>This is the folder for training custom BARTScore</h2>

The code is modified based on [Huggingface example](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples/pytorch/summarization). You can also refer to their code for training.

To train your custom BARTScore, please use the following format for training data file and validation data file.
```
# a train.json/val.json file contains multiple examples as shown below.
{"text": "This is the first text.", "summary": "This is the first summary."}
{"text": "This is the second text.", "summary": "This is the second summary."}
```

An example training command is shown below. More supported arguments can be found in `args.py`.

```bash
python bart.py --train_file train.json --validation_file val.json --output_dir my_bartscore
```

Then you can use your custom BARTScore for evaluation.

## Reproduce
To reproduce our results, please see the folder [`reproduce`](reproduce). Due to limited computing resources, we sharded the BART into multiple GPUs and trained the model, please see [`reproduce/finetune.py`](reproduce/finetune.py) for details.
