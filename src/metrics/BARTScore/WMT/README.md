<h2>This is the folder for the machine translation task.</h2>

The data and most code are borrowed from [COMET Repo](https://github.com/Unbabel/COMET/tree/master/wmt-shared-task/segment-level). Thanks for their work.

<h3>Basics</h3>

We have used **WMT-19** DARR dataset, and considered the follwing language pairs: `de-en`, `fi-en`, `gu-en`, `kk-en`, `lt-en`, `ru-en`, `zh-en`. For each language pair, we converted the original dataset into an unified form as shown below (all texts non-tokenized, normal cased). The unified data form is in each dataset folder, and is named as `data.pkl`. Note that there is another file `final_p.pkl`  in each dataset folder, which is our calculated score file.

```json
{
    "doc_id": {
        "src": "This is the source text.",
        "ref": "This is the reference translation.",
        "better": {
            "sys_name": "System name 1",
            "sys": "This is system translation 1.",
            "scores": {} 
        },
        "worse": {
            "sys_name": "System name 2",
            "sys": "This is system translation 2.",
            "scores": {}
        }
    }
}
```

After calculating scores using automatic metrics, the `scores` field for each system is updated, like the one below. 

```
"scores": {
    "auto_metric1": "0.3", # We use string score to save space
    "auto_metric2": "0.1",
    "auto_metric3": "0.7"
}
```

<h3>Setups</h3>

To use BLEURT, please run the following to set up.

```
git clone https://github.com/google-research/bleurt.git
cd bleurt
pip install .
```

Please run the following commands to download the PRISM model, BLEURT model and COMET model.

```bash
mkdir models
sh download.sh
```

Our trained BARTScore (on ParaBank2) can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_7JfF7KOInb7ZrxKHIigTMR4ChVET01m/view?usp=sharing). Please also move it to the `models` folder for subsequent experiments if you consider using it.


<h3>Run scores</h3>

Run the following to see all the arguments that are supported by the `score.py` script.

```
python score.py --help
```

To reproduce the results, run the following as an example.
```bash
python score.py --file kk-en/data.pkl --device cuda:0 --output kk-en/scores.pkl --bleu --chrf --bleurt --prism --comet --bert_score --bart_score --bart_score_cnn --bart_score_para --prompt bart_para_ref
```
